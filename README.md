Design a visually striking and modern portfolio website for a tech student (MCA background) that showcases projects, skills, resume, and personal information. The website must use Tailwind CSS for styling, embrace dynamic content (such as project galleries, testimonial sliders, animated section reveals, interactive filters), feature bold color contrasts, and incorporate high-quality, relevant background images for maximum visual appeal.

Required Features
Hero Section:
Full-screen background image (subtle, tech-themed or blurred), with dynamic, animated headline text and a clear call to action (e.g., "Download Resume," "Contact Me"). Overlay with contrasting gradient using Tailwind utilities.

About Me Section:
Dynamic content blocks for education, achievements, and skills, with animated progress bars or skill bubbles. Include a playful, colored photo frame (rounded-full, shadow-xl).

Projects Gallery:
An interactive, filterable grid showcasing project thumbnails. Each card animates on hover and expands in a modal with details, screenshots, and technology tabs, styled with vibrant gradients and smooth transitions.

Resume Download & Timeline:
Section for viewing/downloading resume and a vertical timeline for education and achievements, using vivid color accents and icons.

Testimonials/Quote Slider:
Carousel slider for motivational quotes/testimonials (auto-play, swipeable), styled with layered glassmorphism effects over a semi-opaque blurred image background.

Contact:
Stylish form with floating labels, glowing buttons, and animated icons, set against a subtle image or gradient background.

Sticky Navigation & Dark Mode:
Responsive sticky navbar, smooth section scroll, and a one-click dark/light mode toggle using Tailwind dark mode classes.

Footer:
Social icons with color hover effects, visually separated by a wavy SVG divider.

Visual & Technical Guidelines
Use Tailwind CSS extensively—prioritize utility classes for layout, coloring, animation, and typography.

Apply modern color palettes (neon gradients, soft pastels, deep blues/purples, or vibrant tech-themed palettes) for stunning contrast and energy.

Integrate background images smartly—use Unsplash or other copyright-free sources. Apply overlays or blur effects for legibility.

Maximize interactivity with animated buttons, cards, and section transitions (use Tailwind and a JS library like Framer Motion/GSAP/Alpine.js for extra motion if desired).

Ensure elegant mobile responsiveness and progressive enhancement.

All content should be data-driven where possible (e.g., projects loaded from a JSON or CMS for easy updates).

Sample Prompt for ChatGPT or Code Generation Tool
"Design a personal portfolio website for a computer application student using Tailwind CSS. The site should feature a dynamic hero section with a tech-themed background image and animated title, an interactive projects gallery with filterable cards and modals, animated skill progress bars, a motivational quote slider with glassmorphism over blurred backgrounds, a timeline-style education & achievement section, sticky navbar with dark-mode toggle, and a stylish contact form. Use vibrant color schemes, bold contrasts, and subtle background images throughout to maximize appeal and modern aesthetics. All components must be fully responsive, highly interactive, and leverage Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling and animation. Add dynamic content using JavaScript or a framework like React if possible."
